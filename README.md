# 8-puzzle-game-uni-project
This is my 8-puzzle game uni project for our Agile Web Dev unit using html, css, js, bootstrap, flask, sqlite

The task was to build an online daily puzzle, operating in a similar manner to Wordle.The app should have a short daily exercise that users do; the users recieve a score, or a rank, or some kind of feedback; they can share their performance with others through social media or similar mechanisms; and they can track their progress and statistics. It should also be convenient and easy to play via mobile devices, and engaging enough for the users to want to return regularly. The application should be written using HTML, CSS, AJAX, JQuery, and Bootstrap with backend technologies Flask, (Jinja), and sqlite.
